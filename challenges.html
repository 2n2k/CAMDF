  <div class="description">
    <p>In this challenge you will have to understand what it means to be a real man. A real man really all he does is just lifts fucking heavy shit all day and then he listens to music. Well one day our ideal man called Bob was sent an interesting audo file. The audio file was full of boops and beeps and he was surprised because he couldn't understand anything. Do you understand what the audio file says?</p>
